This document has random notes for species evaluation automation for White River. It was started by a detailer, Mike Schmidt, who can be contacted at: michael.schmidt4@usda.gov.

## Taxanomic issues

There is one species that should be added because it is not recognized by GBIF or itis.gov is Furcula vargoi!
